# **CS-499 ePortfolio**

## **Introduction**
   Hello, my name is Luis Sanchez, this ePortfolio showcases the culmination of my work in the Computer Science program at SNHU. Throughout this project, I have refined and enhanced key software engineering skills, particularly in software design, algorithms, data structures, databases, and professional code review practices.

## **Self Assesment** 
  Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have completed numerous courses that have strengthened my skills in software engineering, algorithm design, and database management. The enhancements I made to my projects not only demonstrate my ability to work with full-stack technologies but also support my aspirations to become a Software Engineer. These enhancements directly align with the program outcomes in areas such as software design, algorithms and data structures, databases, and software development best practices. Courses like CS340 gave me valuable insight into how databases function, how to create and store data effectively, and how to secure that data so only authorized users can access it. Database security is crucial because allowing unrestricted access could lead to manipulation, which would create serious issues. 

  Additionally, CS465 equipped me with foundational skills for building robust, full-stack web applications, essential for my pursuit of a career in software engineering. In this course, I learned how to connect client interfaces with server-side functionality and manage databases like MongoDB. I also gained experience with version control tools like Git, preparing me to collaborate effectively in a team environment and communicate with stakeholders, which is vital in the field of software engineering. Clear communication with stakeholders ensures that project requirements are met and helps align technical solutions with business needs.

### **Artifact**
  The original artifact submitted for the portfolio is a Trivia App built with HTML/CSS/Javascript. This app was designed and built in a coding bootcamp course I completed in 2022. The app is a quiz that gives the user ten random questions regarding music albums, the user then has to select one of four multiple choices to answer which artist the album belongs to. A total score is given to the user at the end of the quiz, and the user can restart it after completion. This project serves as a testament to my skills across three key areas of computer science: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

  In the Software Design and Engineering category, I focused on modernizing the application's architecture by transitioning from a traditional codebase to a more structured and maintainable framework. This involved implementing best practices in UI/UX design to create a more engaging and interactive user experience.

  For the Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement, I introduced a binary search tree (BST) algorithm to efficiently sort and retrieve trivia questions in alphabetical order. This improvement not only optimized the app's performance but also showcased my understanding of data structures and algorithmic principles, demonstrating my ability to enhance functionality through efficient coding practices.

  In the Databases category, I integrated a MySQL database to store trivia questions, user answers, and scores, allowing for persistent data management. This enhancement reflects my knowledge in database design and management, ensuring that user data is stored securely and can be accessed seamlessly.

  These enhancements illustrate my approach to software development, highlighting my technical knowledge and ability to apply computer science principles to real-world applications.

## **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

## **Enhancement Two: Data Structures and Algorithms** 

## **Enhancement Three: Databases**
  I chose the Trivia App artifact for this enhancement because it demonstrates my ability to develop a full-stack application with both a front-end interface and a back-end powered by a MySQL database. This Trivia App integrates multiple areas of software development, including database design, server-side programming, and client-side rendering of dynamic content. It reflects my proficiency in developing a structured, data-driven application, from setting up the database schema to handling user interactions in a browser-based interface. The artifact improved from having all the questions stored in a single array of objects to having all the questions stored in a MySQL database.

  In the original artifact, questions were hard-coded and stored in a JavaScript array of objects, but with the implementation of the MySQL database, I transitioned to a more dynamic data storage approach. This enhancement allows for easier management of trivia questions, enabling the app to retrieve, update, and delete questions as needed without altering the codebase.

  I utilized Express.js for the back-end server and MySQL as the database to store quiz questions, showing my skills in full-stack development. I implemented asynchronous fetch requests to ensure the app could dynamically retrieve questions from the server without reloading the page, which enhances user experienceâ€”a key industry goal in web development.

  Additionally, I applied CORS techniques to handle security policies, ensuring that data from the server could be accessed by the client-side code, reflecting my understanding of real-world security practices. By combining front-end JavaScript with database-driven content, I showcased how modern computing practices can be used to create a seamless, interactive experience that delivers value by allowing users to engage with dynamically generated quiz content.

  While enhancing and modifying the database-backed Trivia App artifact, I learned a lot about integrating front-end functionality with a back-end database and how different components communicate to create a dynamic, interactive user experience.

  One of the key challenges was managing data flow between the server, database, and client-side code, particularly with the implementation of CORS and fetching data asynchronously. Setting up a MySQL database and ensuring the right data is retrieved for the quiz questions was also tricky, as it required understanding SQL queries and ensuring the database was structured correctly. Another challenge was ensuring that the quiz app remained responsive and interactive, even when fetching data from the server, and handling issues such as missing or incorrect data. This required testing and troubleshooting server responses, as well as improving the user interface to handle errors gracefully.


  All of the course outcomes were met in this enhancement by designing the database schema to store quiz questions efficiently. I used structured SQL queries to retrieve data dynamically based on user input. This highlights my understanding of algorithmic efficiency when dealing with relational data, ensuring that database operations were optimized for performance. I made trade-offs between various approaches for data handling. For example, I opted for a relational database over storing data in a JSON file for scalability, despite the added complexity of setting up a MySQL server. This decision allowed for better query performance. 

  I also demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. This project demonstrates how innovative tools like Node.js, MySQL, and Fetch API can be used to accomplish industry-specific goals, such as building responsive, scalable web applications. It also shows how important connecting various components such as the client, server, and database, in an efficient and effective manner, ensuring the solution is both functional and user-friendly.

  I also accomplished the course outcome of designing, developing, and delivering professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.
