# **CS-499 ePortfolio**

## **Introduction**
   Hello, my name is Luis Sanchez, this ePortfolio showcases the culmination of my work in the Computer Science program at SNHU. Throughout this project, I have refined and enhanced key software engineering skills, particularly in software design, algorithms, data structures, databases, and professional code review practices.

## **Self Assesment** 
  Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have completed numerous courses that have strengthened my skills in software engineering, algorithm design, and database management. The enhancements I made to my projects not only demonstrate my ability to work with full-stack technologies but also support my aspirations to become a Software Engineer. These enhancements directly align with the program outcomes in areas such as software design, algorithms and data structures, databases, and software development best practices. Courses like CS340 gave me valuable insight into how databases function, how to create and store data effectively, and how to secure that data so only authorized users can access it. Database security is crucial because allowing unrestricted access could lead to manipulation, which would create serious issues. 

  Additionally, CS465 equipped me with foundational skills for building robust, full-stack web applications, essential for my pursuit of a career in software engineering. In this course, I learned how to connect client interfaces with server-side functionality and manage databases like MongoDB. I also gained experience with version control tools like Git, preparing me to collaborate effectively in a team environment and communicate with stakeholders, which is vital in the field of software engineering. Clear communication with stakeholders ensures that project requirements are met and helps align technical solutions with business needs.

  ## **Artifact**
  The original artifact submitted for the portfolio is a Trivia App built with HTML/CSS/Javascript. This project serves as a testament to my skills across three key areas of computer science: software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.

  In the Software Design and Engineering category, I focused on modernizing the application's architecture by transitioning from a traditional codebase to a more structured and maintainable framework. This involved implementing best practices in UI/UX design to create a more engaging and interactive user experience.

  For the Algorithms and Data Structures enhancement, I introduced a binary search tree (BST) algorithm to efficiently sort and retrieve trivia questions in alphabetical order. This improvement not only optimized the app's performance but also showcased my understanding of data structures and algorithmic principles, demonstrating my ability to enhance functionality through efficient coding practices.

  In the Databases category, I integrated a MySQL database to store trivia questions, user answers, and scores, allowing for persistent data management. This enhancement reflects my knowledge in database design and management, ensuring that user data is stored securely and can be accessed seamlessly.

  These enhancements illustrate my approach to software development, highlighting my technical knowledge and ability to apply computer science principles to real-world applications.
