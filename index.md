# **CS-499 ePortfolio**

## **Introduction**
   Hello, my name is Luis Sanchez, this ePortfolio showcases the culmination of my work in the Computer Science program at SNHU. Throughout this project, I have refined and enhanced key software engineering skills, particularly in software design, algorithms, data structures, databases, and professional code review practices.

## **Self Assesment** 
  Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I have completed numerous courses that have strengthened my skills in software engineering, algorithm design, and database management. The enhancements I made to my projects not only demonstrate my ability to work with full-stack technologies but also support my aspirations to become a Software Engineer. These enhancements directly align with the program outcomes in areas such as software design, algorithms and data structures, databases, and software development best practices. Courses like CS340 gave me valuable insight into how databases function, how to create and store data effectively, and how to secure that data so only authorized users can access it. Database security is crucial because allowing unrestricted access could lead to manipulation, which would create serious issues. 

  Additionally, CS465 equipped me with foundational skills for building robust, full-stack web applications, essential for my pursuit of a career in software engineering. In this course, I learned how to connect client interfaces with server-side functionality and manage databases like MongoDB. I also gained experience with version control tools like Git, preparing me to collaborate effectively in a team environment, which is vital in the field of software engineering.
